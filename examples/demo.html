Binomial Theorem
----------------

$$ (x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} x^{n - k} y^k $$


Exponential Function
--------------------

$$ e^x = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( 1+ \frac{x}{n} \right)^n $$


Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
-------------------------

$$
    \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq
    \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right)
    \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$


Bayes' Theorem
--------------

$$ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \, P(A)}{P(B)} $$


Euler's Summation Formula
-------------------------

**Theorem** (Euler's summation formula). _If $f$ has a continuous
derivative $f'$ on the interval $[y, x]$, where $0 < y < x$, then_

\begin{align}
\sum_{y < n \le x} f(n) = & \int_y^x f(t) dt +
                            \int_y^x (t - [t]) f'(t) dt \notag \\
                          & + f(x)([x] - x) - f(y)([y] - y).
\label{theorem}
\end{align}

_Proof._ Let $m = [y]$, $k = [x]$. For integers $n$ and $n - 1$
in $[y, x]$ we have
\begin{align*}
\int_{n-1}^n [t] f'(t) dt & = \int_{n-1}^n f'(t) dt \\
                          & = (n - 1) \bigl( f(n) - f(n - 1)
                                      \bigr) \\
                          & = \bigl(
                                n f(n) - (n - 1) f(n - 1)
                              \bigr) - f(n).
\end{align*}
Summing from $n = m + 1$ to $n = k$ we find
\begin{align*}
\int_{m}^k [t] f'(t) dt & = \sum_{n = m + 1}^k \bigl(
                                n f(n) - (n - 1) f(n - 1)
                            \bigr) - \sum_{y < n \le x} f(n) \\
                        & = k f(k) - m f(m) -
                            \sum_{y < n \le x} f(n).
\end{align*}
Hence,
\begin{align}
\sum_{y < n \le x} f(n) & = - \int_{m}^k [t] f'(t) dt +
                              k f(k) - m f(m) \notag \\
                        & = - \int_{y}^x [t] f'(t) dt +
                              k f(x) - m f(y).
\label{summation}
\end{align}
Integration by parts gives us
\begin{equation*}
\int_y^x f(t) dt = x f(x) - y f(y) - \int_y^x t f'(t) dt.
\end{equation*}
When this is combined with \eqref{summation} we obtain
\eqref{theorem}.

Hello World Program
-------------------

Here is an example of `"hello, world"` program written in the C
programming language:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}
```


Issac Newton Quotes
-------------------

Issac Newton was relatively modest about his achievements, writing in a
letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676:

> If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.

In a later memoir, Newton wrote:

> I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to
> have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting
> myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell
> than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered
> before me.
